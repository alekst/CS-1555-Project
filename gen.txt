* Description of the approach to generating data for the database
*/

The random data for each person is generated by a series of nested loops.
A Random object is used to generate random integers and floats. The integers are
used to build up StringBuilder objects of random lengths, also using other
random integers as indicies for selecting a random letter from a predefined
alphabet. These letters are appended to a StringBuilder one by one, until the
length is satisfied.

Random floats, such as those used for dollar amounts and discounts are built by using
both a random int and a random float, which are then added together.

Most of these functions are accomplished by using several short helper methods
which were written to simplify the main code block.
